    "### ML overview\n",
    "- use ML where:\n",
    "    - you cannot program the rules\n",
    "    - you cannot scale\n",
    "- Goal\n",
    "    - split training (70%), evaluation and test data\n",
    "    - generalize model beyond training data\n",
    "- Learning Algorithm\n",
    "    - algorithm's job is to learn weights of the model\n",
    "        - weights describe the likelihood that the patterns the model is learning reflect actual relationships in the data\n",
    "    - consists of:\n",
    "        - loss function\n",
    "            - loss = penalty incured when [predicted value of the ML model] != [actual value]\n",
    "            - loss fuction quantifies loss into a value\n",
    "            - AWS uses 3 loss functions\n",
    "                - binary classification: logistic loss function + SGD\n",
    "                - multiclass classification: multinomial logistic regression = multinomial logistic loss + SGD\n",
    "                - regression: linear regression = squared loss function + SGD\n",
    "        - optimization technique\n",
    "            - seeks to minimize loss\n",
    "            - AWS ML uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as optimization technique\n",
    "- Hyperparameters\n",
    "    - aka ML options\n",
    "    - If you want to be more prescriptive about the parameters you want to use for a specific machine learning model, Amazon Machine Learning allows you to do this by selecting Custom when creating your model; otherwise, aws has predefined hyperparameters\n",
    "    - Learning Rate\n",
    "        - constant value used in the SGD algorithm\n",
    "        - affects the rate at which the algorithm reaches or converges to the optimal weight\n",
    "    - Model Size\n",
    "    - Number of Passes\n",
    "        - more passes == fits data better; but too much passes can decrease this (overtraining?)\n",
    "    - data shuffling \n",
    "        - helps with SGD by avoiding solutions that may be optimal for the first set of data instead of the full range\n",
    "    - regularization \n",
    "        - helps prevent linear models from overfitting training data examples by penalizing extreme weight values\n",
    "        - overfitting = good at predicting training but not more generalized data\n",
    "- can generate two types of predictions\n",
    "    1. Real Time: for a single observation\n",
    "        - must create a real time prediction endpoint\n",
    "    2. Batch: for a group of observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "- makes sequential passes over the training data and updates the feature weights, one example at a time, with the aim of approaching the optimal weights that minimize the loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS ML Steps\n",
    "1. Prepare data\n",
    "2. Create training data sources\n",
    "3. Create an ML model\n",
    "4. Review ML model's predictive performance\n",
    "5. use ML model to generate predictions (using test data set)\n",
    "6. clean up AWS environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Model\n",
    "1. to prepare data, make Yes/No or True/False to 1/0; store data in S3\n",
    "2. create data source\n",
    "    - ML object with location of input data and metadata\n",
    "    - provide aws s3 (or redshift) location, schema, name and attributes (numeric, text, binary, categorical), target attribute\n",
    "        - schema: info amazon ml requires to interpret the input data\n",
    "        - can either provide a schema file or allow aws ml to infer attribute types\n",
    "    - Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "        - YY: True Positive\n",
    "        - YN: False Negative\n",
    "        - NY: False Positive\n",
    "        - NN: True Negative\n",
    "3. Set binary model's predictive performance\n",
    "    - increase the score threshold to limit false negatives\n",
    "    - want to focus on 5% of records predicted as 1:\n",
    "        - more true positives; people will buy\n",
    "        - less false positives because false positives can be a big money waster; predicting people will buy but actually didn't  \n",
    "    - aws ml stores results in the result subfolder\n",
    "    - if AUC metric returns a value close to zero, there is probably something wrong with the data set\n",
